Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!

My Answer 

For Refactor + Unite Test:
The code provides functionalities to accept, cancel, and end a job and resend notifications. It uses a repository to delegate the job operations and obtain the authenticated user from the request object.

The code follows a common pattern of receiving the request data, obtaining the authenticated user, calling the repository method with the parameters, and returning the response. The code structure and formatting are consistent, making it easy to read and understand.

However, the code does not have any error handling and does not validate the input data, which could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the application. Additionally, the naming of the methods could be improved to be more descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.

For Unite Test case I have noticed just 2 points 

Code Optimization: The code is using the firstOrNew method to create or update the user. This method could lead to race conditions if multiple requests try to create the same user simultaneously. It would be best to use a transaction and lock the user record to avoid such issues.

Formatting: The code formatting could be improved. For example, using consistent indentation and line breaks can make the code easier to read.

Overall, the code is functional, but it can be improved in terms of structure, error handling, and optimization. To make it amazing code, it would need to be refactored to address these issues.
